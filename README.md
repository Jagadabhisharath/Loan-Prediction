# Loan-Prediction
# Exploratory Data Analysis for Loan Prediction
This project conducts a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a loan prediction dataset. The primary goal is to understand the underlying patterns in the data, identify key factors that influence loan approval, and prepare the data for building a predictive model.
# Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to analyze a dataset of loan applications to identify trends and relationships that can inform lending decisions. By exploring the data, we aim to uncover insights into the factors that are most predictive of loan approval. This analysis serves as a foundational step for developing a machine learning model to automate the loan eligibility process.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various details about loan applicants, including:
* Loan_ID: A unique identifier for each loan application.
* Gender: The gender of the applicant (Male/Female).
* Married: The marital status of the applicant (Yes/No).
* Dependents: The number of dependents the applicant has.
* Education: The applicant's education level (Graduate/Not Graduate).
* Self_Employed: Whether the applicant is self-employed (Yes/No).
* ApplicantIncome: The income of the primary applicant.
* CoapplicantIncome: The income of the co-applicant.
* LoanAmount: The loan amount requested.
* Loan_Amount_Term: The term of the loan in months.
* Credit_History: Whether the applicant has a credit history that meets the guidelines.
* Property_Area: The location of the property (Urban/Semiurban/Rural).
* Loan_Status: The final status of the loan (Y/N).
# Methodology
This project follows a structured approach to data analysis and preprocessing:
1. Data Loading and Initial Inspection: The dataset is loaded, and its basic properties, such as the number of rows and columns, data types, and a preview of the data, are examined.
2. Handling Missing Data: Missing values are identified and addressed using various techniques. For categorical features, forward-fill (ffill) and back-fill (bfill) methods are used, while for numerical features, missing values are imputed with the mean, median, or mode. Additionally, KNNImputer is explored as an alternative for imputing missing values.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Univariate Analysis: The distribution of individual variables is analyzed. For categorical features, bar charts and pie charts are used to visualize the frequency of each category. For numerical features, histograms and box plots are used to understand their distribution and identify outliers.
* Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis: The relationships between different variables are explored. crosstab is used to examine the relationship between categorical variables, and correlation heatmaps are used to analyze the relationships between numerical variables.
4. Feature Engineering and Preprocessing:
* Categorical Encoding: Categorical variables are converted into a numerical format using LabelEncoder and pd.get_dummies to make them suitable for machine learning models.
* Numerical Scaling: Numerical features, such as ApplicantIncome, are scaled using StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler to normalize their range and prevent features with larger scales from dominating the model.
5. Data Transformation: To address skewed data distributions, various transformation techniques are applied, including:
* Log Transformation: To reduce the impact of outliers and make the distribution more normal.
* Reciprocal and Square Root Transformations: To stabilize variance and normalize the data.
* Power Transformation: To create a more uniform distribution.
# Key Findings
* The dataset contains a mix of categorical and numerical features, with some columns having missing values that require careful handling.
* The ApplicantIncome is right-skewed, indicating that a few applicants have very high incomes.
* There is a clear correlation between Credit_History and Loan_Status, suggesting that applicants with a good credit history are more likely to have their loans approved.
* The Property_Area also appears to influence loan approval, with semi-urban areas having a higher approval rate.
# Tools and Libraries
* Python: The programming language used for the analysis.
* Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
* NumPy: For numerical operations.
* Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
* Scikit-learn: For data preprocessing, including encoding and scaling.
